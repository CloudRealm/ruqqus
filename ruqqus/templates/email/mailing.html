We hope you're enjoying your time on Ruqqus. To help keep Ruqqus operational into the future, we're making some terms of service changes, which will go into effect on $date. As a reminder, your continued use of the Ruqqus platform after that date constitutes agreement to these changes.

Here's a summary of what we're adding.

1. **Governing Law clause** - This indicates that we are operating under New Hampshire law, and requires users to consent to the jurisdiction of New Hampshire courts. We added this as a protection against getting sued somewhere we can't easily travel to.

2. **Stronger anti-account-sharing language** - This is an important protection for you, against overly nosy third parties who want to snoop through your social media accounts. 

3. **Rules clarification** - We've clarified a few points in our content policy to help reduce the "grey area" type cases. We recognize that many things can be open for interpretation and personal judgement, and we want to make sure you have a good idea of what to expect from us.
